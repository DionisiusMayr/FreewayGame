    "When a chicken is successfully guided across the freeway, it is awarded one point and moved to the initial space, where it will try to cross the street again.\n",
    "The game offers multiple scenarios with different vehicles configurations (varying the type, frequency and speed of them) and plays for 2 minutes and 16 seconds.\n",

For each of them, we experimented with different sets of features to represent the state-action pairs, varied reward functions, different exploration rates, and in all of them we used only two actions (move backward and move forward), which were the best actions found by the tabular methods.\n",
