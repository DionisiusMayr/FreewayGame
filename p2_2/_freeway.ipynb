    "When a chicken is successfully guided across the freeway, it is awarded one point and moved to the initial space, where it will try to cross the street again.\n",
    "The game offers multiple scenarios with different vehicles configurations (varying the type, frequency and speed of them) and plays for 2 minutes and 16 seconds.\n",
